Our connection to Acuity Scheduling enables you to create reports and dashboards on your appointments and orders. Look at trends in new vs. followup meetings, sales by product, and more. Combine your Acuity Scheduling data with other SaaS products to get a full view of the client.

Our connection to Less Annoying CRM provides our usual reporting on Less Annoying CRM's highly flexible data. Custom fields and custom pipelines are both pulled into Easy Insight by the connection.
