We've made several improvements to FreshBooks in the last couple of weeks.<!--more--> First, we've significantly improved the performance of data retrieval for certain cases, particularly accounts with large amounts of time tracking data. Next, we've added the Client Folder field to Client, Invoice Created By, Invoice View URL, Invoice Client URL, and Invoice Edit URL to Invoices, and Project Budget to Projects. Finally, it should now be easier to set up automatic nightly refresh on a FreshBooks source through the Scheduling page.
