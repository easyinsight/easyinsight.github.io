Gantt charts now support using a hierarchy instead of just a single grouping, allowing you to define rollup and drilldown views across your projects, tasks lists, and individual tasks.

You can now also specify the same date field as start and end--for example, you might select the task due date as both start and end on the Gantt chart. Easy Insight will do the rest from there, calculating the rendering of the bars as they go across projects and task lists.
