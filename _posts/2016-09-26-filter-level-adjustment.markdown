One quick improvement to announce this week! You can now click on the filter label of your Year/Quarter/Month range filters and change the filter level in the end user view of your report or dashboard. <!-- more -->

This change should automatically be applied to any year/quarter/month range filter, making it easier for your end users to apply more robust filters.

If you want to disable the setting, you can edit the filter and uncheck the "Allow End User to Change Date Level" option.
