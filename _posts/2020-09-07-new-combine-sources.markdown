We have several major changes to combined data sources for this week, helping you to more easily create reports and dashboards across different data sources.<!--more-->

<h2>Quicker Creation</h2>

When you create a new combined data source, you can automatically populate the data source (and joins if possible) through a setup window.

<h2>Reports and Dashboards</h2>

New combined data sources automatically show the reports and dashboards from their individual sources. If you want to take a particular report or dashboard and move it to the combined level so that you can add fields from another source, you can do QUick Actions -> Convert to Combined Source. 

<h2>Join Tables</h2>

Have mismatched data that you need to join together? You can define join tables inside of Easy Insight to map records yourself. 

For more information on these changes, see our updated documentation at <a href="https://www.easy-insight.com/docs/data_sources/combining-data-sources.html">https://www.easy-insight.com/docs/data_sources/combining-data-sources.html</a> and check out the new video below covering combining data sources.
