We've rolled out a new connection to <a href="https://www.clickup.com">ClickUp</a> to help you extend your project management reporting. 

This connection includes prebuilt reports around workload, completed work, and more in a variety of tables and charts. Beyond the prebuilt reports, you can create your own rich custom reports on your ClickUp data as well.

You can check out an intro video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An0wYqTatYc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An0wYqTatYc</a> to give you an introduction to Easy Insight and ClickUp. Enjoy!
