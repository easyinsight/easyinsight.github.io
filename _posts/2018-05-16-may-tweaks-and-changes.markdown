As we finish up our GDPR work, we've also found time to make some further improvements as well. When you edit fields in the report editor, the edit is now through a movable window instead of a separate page. This change makes it easier to see your existing report data as you edit fields, as well as avoiding unnecessary lengthy report refreshes.

We've also got a long list of small changes:

<ul>
    <li>Process dashboards do a better job of handling out of sequence steps and calculating duration from those out of sequence steps.</li>
    <li>User source imports give you the option of refreshing from Dropbox.</li>
    <li>You can now reorder your Top Reports and Dashboards.</li>
    <li>There's a new option of "Fill In Zeroes" for column charts which allows you to automatically generate zero values for dates with no data.</li>
    <li>Dashboard PDFs will use your PDF settings in all cases.</li>
    <li>You can hide Form report fields with no data by toggling the "Hide if No Data" option.</li>
</ul>

We have much more coming in the next couple of months as well!
