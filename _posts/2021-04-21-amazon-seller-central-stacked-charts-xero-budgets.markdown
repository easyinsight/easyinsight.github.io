<h2 class="productHeader">Xero Budgets</h2>

We've added reporting on Xero budgets! You can now access your budget, budget line, and budget balance fields from your Xero connection in Easy Insight. Create reports to track your financial performance against the budgets you've defined in Xero.

<h2 class="productHeader">Smaller Fixes and Updates</h2>

The text color on tree maps should now render as white if the tree map color is a darker shade, helping to make tree maps easier to read.

We made several fixes and improvements to the load of LOCATE Inventory and Shopify connection data.

With two way functionality, you can now create deals and contacts in Hubspot from your Easy Insight reports and integrations.

We've added AED as a currency option under International and Locale Settings.
