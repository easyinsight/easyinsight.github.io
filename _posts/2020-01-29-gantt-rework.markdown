For this week, we have an overhauled Gantt report!<!--more-->

We've made a wide range of enhancements to our Gantt charts to meet with various customer requests.

When creating a Gantt chart, you simply add the different fields such as Project Name, Task List Name, and Task Name to the report instead of explicitly creating a hierarchy. 

You can also now add a measure to the report to represent the thickness of the Gantt chart bars and display as a column. You might use Task Hours, Estimated Hours, Estimated Points, or whatever other field makes sense.

We've enhanced the date filtering for Gantt charts to show anything falling into the range specified by the date filter. For example, if your date filter goes from January to June, and a task has a range of April to October, the task will show up from April to June.

The Gantt chart defaults to displaying data at a month level, controlled by a dropdown in the upper left of the chart. You can change the view to Week or Day. If you save the report at a particular level, the end user version of the report will default to that level.

You can click on the column headers to sort by the hierarchy values, the start date, or the end date. Click again to reverse the sort.

If you apply conditional formatting to the hierarchy values, the label and the bar itself will take on the colors specified through the conditional formatting.

To get started, simply create a new Gantt chart. Or if you want to convert an existing Gantt chart to the new model, open the chart in the editor and click on Quick Actions - Convert to New Gantt.
