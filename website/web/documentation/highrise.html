        <h2><a name="r1">How do I connect to <a href="http://highrisehq.com/">Highrise?</a></a></h2>

        <p>First, you need an Easy Insight account! If you don't already have an account, you can create one <a
                href="/app/newaccount/">by clicking here</a>. Once you've created an account, you'll either be taken
            directly to the Highrise connection page or to the standard application landing page. From the standard
            application landing page, you can install a connection to Highrise by clicking over to the Connections page,
            clicking on the Highrise button, and clicking on Get Started Now.</p>

        <p>You'll need to enable API access to your Highrise account. You can enable this access from the Account
            (Upgrade/Invoice) page of your Highrise account. If this option is unavailable, you may need to contact your
            Highrise administrator.</p>

        <p>At this point, you'll be prompted for your Highrise path and your API token. You can find your API token
            under the My Info page on your Highrise interface. Once you click Create, Easy Insight will begin
            synchronizing key aggregate data from your Highrise account into the Easy Insight data warehouse. Depending
            on the size of your Highrise instance, this process may take a while--if you have hundreds of deals and
            thousands of contacts,, it might be several minutes to copy all of the necessary data across. Once
            synchronization is complete, a wizard will walk you through an initial scorecard and next steps with the
            data source.</p>

        <h2><a name="r2">What Highrise data is available for reporting?</a></h2>

        <p>You can report on Cases, Companies, Contacts, Deals, Emails, and Tasks, and Notes.</p>

        <h2><a name="r3">How do I build a report on deals?</a></h2>

        <p>First, click on Create New Report from the Home page. This will take you to the Easy Insight report
            editor.</p>

        <div style="padding-top:10px;margin:0px;float:right">
            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjIvoUnIDVU" class="vidbox" rel="vidbox"><img
                    style="padding:0px 10px 10px" src="/images/IntroStart.jpg"
                    alt="Highrise Screencast"/></a>

            <div align="center" style="font-size:18px;color:#000000">Reporting on Deals</div>
        </div>

        <p>For any report on your Highrise data, we recommend that you take advantage of the suggested actions. You can
            find these actions in the upper right corner of your screen. You should see "Help Me Set up a Deal Report",
            as an option. Click on that option and confirm the suggestion action.</p>

        <p>Once you've applied this suggestion, the report will show you the set of all Deals in your Highrise system.
            From this basic report, you can drag other fields into the report to build out whatever other data you need
            to see.
            For example, open up the Deals folder in the left hand list and drag Total Deal Value into the report to see
            the value of each deal. Next, you can add the
            contacts and companies matching with deal by opening up the Company folder and adding Company Name to the
            report and opening up the Contact folder and adding
            Contact Name to the report.</p>

        <p>Now that you have basic information in the report, you can add a filter to only show those deals which are in
            a pending state. Open up the Filters tab
            in the top section of the editor. Click on New Filter and choose Status from the dropdown box. Click Create
            Filter. You'll be asked what type of filter
            you want to create. Choose a single value filter so that you can restrict the data to a single value. The
            result of this action is that you'll have a dropdown
            box showing the various possible status values of deals. Select Pending and the report filters down to only
            show pending deals.</p>

        <h2><a name="r4">How do I build a report on cases?</a></h2>

        <p>Follow the same approach as you used in creating a report on deals, just selecting "Help Me Set up a Case Report" instead.</p>

        <h2><a name="r5">How do I build a report on tasks?</a></h2>

        <p>Follow the same approach as you used in creating a report on deals, just selecting "Help Me Set up a Task Report" instead.</p>

        <h2><a name="r6">How do I build a report on activities?</a></h2>

        <p>Activities span tasks, notes, and emails. Follow the same approach as you used in creating a report on deals, just selecting "Help Me Set up an Activity Report" instead. You may need to click on "More Suggestions" to find this option.</p>

        <h2><a name="r7">How can I add custom fields?</a></h2>

        <p>You can add any custom field to your Highrise data inside of Easy Insight. One common scenario is deal
            probability--how likely is this deal to close?</p>

        <p>As the first step, you'll add some custom notation to the fields in Highrise. The notation is:</p>
        <pre><code>[Field Name: Value]</code></pre>
        <img src="../images/HighriseProbability.png" style="float:right;padding:10px;"
             alt="Display of Reports under My Data"/>

        <p style="padding-top:20px">So for our deal probability, we'll add this notation to our Deal names in Highrise,
            so that a deal with the name of "Pro Services to Customer XYZ" would become "Pro Services to Customer XYZ
            [Prob:50]". You can see in the screenshot to the right a sample of how this looks in the Highrise interface.
            Prob is an arbitrary name we've chosen to represent Probability--you could do [Probability: 50] or [P:50],
            just up to what you feel will be the best fit for your sales team. You can add multiple fields in this way
            as well--if you wanted to add Channel as well, you could do something along the lines of "Pro Services to
            Customer XYZ [Prob: 50] [Channel:Direct Marketing]".</p>

        <p>Next, open up the report editor in Easy Insight. You'll be creating a Calculated field, so click to the Data
            tab, then click on Create Calculation. This action opens up the window for defining a new calculation. For
            this particular scenario, you'll be using the "namedbracketvalue" function. This function has the signature
            of:</p>
        <pre><code>namedbracketvalue(Field Name, Custom Field Name)</code></pre>
        <p>So for our earlier examples of [Prob:50], we would do the following as our calculation:</p>
        <img src="../images/ProbabilityEditor.png" style="float:left;padding:10px;"
             alt="Display of Reports under My Data"/>

        <p style="padding-top:70px">The calculation of namedbracketvalue(Deal Name, "Prob") defined in the Calculation
            input is stating that the calculation will look for bracketed values in the Deal Name field where the name
            of the custom field is Prob. If you wanted to do the aforementioned Channel instead, it would just be
            namedbracketvalue(Deal Name, "Channel"). If you wanted to apply the same functionality to some other
            Highrise field, you'd just use the appropriate field name as the first parameter to namedbracketvalue.</p>

        <p style="padding-bottom:70px">Setting the Formatting to Percentage will ensure that the value is displayed in %
            form. Row Level can be a little confusing at first, but it simply states that the calculation will be
            applied for each row of data, rather than after the data has been aggregated.</p>
        <img src="../images/ProbabilityReport.png" style="float:right;padding:10px;"
             alt="Display of Reports under My Data"/>

        <p style="padding-top:40px">If you drag Deal Name and the newly defined Deal Probability field into the report,
            you'll see the deal probabilities as matching with your data in Highrise, as shown in this example to the
            right.</p>

        <p style="padding-bottom:20px">The next step is to create a further calculated field representing probability
            adjusted deal value. We'll create a second calculation. For this one, the value will be:</p>
        <pre><code>Total Deal Value * Deal Probability / 100</code></pre>
        <p>Set the value to a Currency, drag it into the report, and just like that, you have a full view of deals with
            their values, probabilities, and probability adjusted values! You can <a

                screencast</a> for a video walkthrough of this process.</p>
